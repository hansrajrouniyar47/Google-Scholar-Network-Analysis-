# Google-Scholar-Network-Analysis-
This repo contains our project work done on analysing the network analysis of google scholar as part of Social Information Network Course- CSE3021

As a part of course project me and my team mate Sundaram Yadav worked on identifying the co-creation organization and reference measurements by establishing a connection between page rank and centrality measures.
